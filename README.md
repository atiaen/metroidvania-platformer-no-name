# General Information

This project is a guide and learning tool for me and anyone interested in gamedev to help build platformer games.

The aim of this project is to give anyone a base to learn on how to make platforming based games.

This project is currently using <a href="https://o-lobster.itch.io/platformmetroidvania-pixel-art-asset-pack">this asset pack</a> from o_lobster on itch.io.
Although this might change depending on the creator. (I purchased this pack as part of a bundle in 2020).

I have yet to write an indepth guide on how to use this framework but feel free to poke around and get feel for how the project is structured.
