# General Information

This project is a guide and learning tool for me and anyone interested in gamedev to help build platformer games.

I am by no means an "Expert Game Developer" and there are mistakes and errors made in this project but the aim of this project is to give people a base to learn 
how to make platforming based games.

This project is currently using this asset pack from o_lobster on itch.io <a>https://o-lobster.itch.io/platformmetroidvania-pixel-art-asset-pack.</a>
Although this might change depending on the creator. (I purchased this pack as part of a bundle in 2020).

I have yet to write an indepth guide on how to use this framework but feel free to poke around and get feel for how the project is structured.
